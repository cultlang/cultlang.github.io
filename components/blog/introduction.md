## Introduction

As a way to exercise my new programming language - Cult - I am doing the advent of code challenges. Part of this will include improving the language - through the standard library, the interpreter, or other features - as I do the challenges. Additionally I will be taking time to explain my reasoning for solving the problems the way I do, and hence the design of the language.

Eventually this blog will host other cult related content. For now it will just be my thoughts as I work on it.
